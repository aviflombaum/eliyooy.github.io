My journey to being a software developer was a funny one, but the "after" is more interesting than the "before."  Like many law school graduates, I was not thrilled about the prospect of joining the legal profession.  I thus searched (desperately) for something - anything resembling a different career.  I still remember the moment when I typed the words "computer programming" into the search bar.  At the time it seemed like a fantasy, a sort of last resort that I would dismiss in minutes.  In college, I had friends who worked in computer programming, and cannot remember for an entire four years asking a single question about it.  The field seemed impossibly boring to me.
 
Yet here we are.  After discovering Codecademy the rest was history.  I discovered that computer programming is not the following things: numbers, symbols, dots, processors, and blinking lights.  What I discovered, rather, is that computer programming can be better described like this: architecture, art, engineering, science, and storytelling.  Getting even a cursory look at the art (and science) of programming is to realize the enormous creative potential of this field.  It's been a great experience for me, certainly, to grow in my knowledge of it and to learn how to apply it in increasingly complex ways.

So when I say the "after" is more interesting than the "before," I mean exactly that.  My route to discovering programming was as simply as typing it into a search bar.  What came after - as many a programmer already knows - is far more interesting.
